   Selecting **does not require a record** means that we don't need to have an alert to start the playbook. This is useful for testing and for playbooks that don't need to be tied to an alert.

Create a manual trigger playbook that prompts the user for an IP address and then blocks the IP address on a FortiGate.

#### Challenge 3

Create a playbook that adds the text `Alert has been Closed` to the description field of an alert when the status is updated to `Closed`.
