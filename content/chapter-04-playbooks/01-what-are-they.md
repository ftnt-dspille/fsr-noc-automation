## What is a playbook

A playbook is a set of procedures that can be executed in response to a security incident. Playbooks can be used to automate repetitive tasks, such as gathering information, enriching data, and executing remediation actions. Playbooks can be created using the FortiSOAR Playbook Editor, which provides a visual interface for designing and configuring playbooks.

Playbooks are akin to a functional programming language, with capabilities to handle internal processes and external integrations

## Why use playbooks

Playbooks can embody best practices and guide users through the process of responding to a security incident. This means that the users of playbooks don't need to be experts in the tools and processes that are used to respond to an incident. More advanced users can create playbooks and expose them to less experienced users, who can then execute the playbooks to respond to incidents.
