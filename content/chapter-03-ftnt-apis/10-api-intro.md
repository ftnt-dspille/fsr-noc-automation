## What is a REST API?

Think of a REST API like ordering pizza over the phone. You call the pizza place (API endpoint), tell them what you want (HTTP request), and they respond with your order status or the pizza itself (HTTP response).

**Key Concept:** REST APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform operations, just like standardized ways to order food.

## The Four Essential HTTP Methods (Pizza Edition)

| Method     | Pizza Action                          | What It Does          | Network Equivalent               |
|------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| **GET**    | "What pizzas do you have?"            | View the menu         | Get device status, view policies |
| **POST**   | "I'd like to order a large pepperoni" | Create new order      | Add firewall rule, create VLAN   |
| **PUT**    | "Change my order to extra cheese"     | Update existing order | Modify interface config          |
| **DELETE** | "Cancel my order"                     | Remove the order      | Delete policies, remove devices  |

## REST API Structure (Pizza Restaurant)

**Base URL:** `https://tonys-pizza.com/api/v1/`

**Pizza Endpoints:**

```
GET    /menu                       # See what's available
GET    /orders/12345              # Check your specific order
POST   /orders                    # Place a new order
PUT    /orders/12345              # Change your order
DELETE /orders/12345              # Cancel your order
```

**Network Endpoints:**

```
GET    /devices                   # List all devices
GET    /devices/fw-01            # Get specific device info
POST   /devices                  # Add new device
PUT    /devices/fw-01/config     # Update device config
DELETE /devices/fw-01            # Remove device
```

## HTTP Status Codes (Pizza Responses)

| Code    | Pizza Meaning                           | Network Meaning | When You See It           |
|---------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **200** | "Your pizza is ready!"                  | Success         | Operation completed       |
| **201** | "Order placed successfully!"            | Created         | New resource created      |
| **400** | "We don't have pineapple pizza"         | Bad Request     | Invalid data sent         |
| **401** | "You need to give us your phone number" | Unauthorized    | Authentication failed     |
| **404** | "That pizza doesn't exist"              | Not Found       | Resource doesn't exist    |
| **500** | "Our oven is broken"                    | Server Error    | API/device internal error |

## Request/Response Format

**Pizza Order Request:**

```http
POST /api/v1/orders HTTP/1.1
Host: tonys-pizza.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer customer-loyalty-card-123

{
  "size": "large",
  "toppings": ["pepperoni", "mushrooms"],
  "crust": "thin",
  "delivery_address": "123 Main St"
}
```

**Pizza Order Response:**

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "order_id": 12345,
  "status": "preparing",
  "estimated_time": "25 minutes",
  "total": "$18.99"
}
```

**Network Policy Request:**

```http
POST /api/v1/firewall/policies HTTP/1.1
Host: fortigate.company.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer your-token-here

{
  "name": "Allow-Web-Traffic",
  "source": "LAN",
  "destination": "WAN", 
  "service": "HTTP"
}
```

## JSON Data Format (Pizza Menu Style)

```json
{
  "pizza": {
    "name": "Supreme Deluxe",
    "size": "large",
    "price": 22.99,
    "toppings": [
      {
        "name": "pepperoni",
        "extra": false
      },
      {
        "name": "cheese",
        "extra": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Network Device Format:**

```json
{
  "device": {
    "hostname": "fw-branch-01",
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",
    "model": "FortiGate-60F",
    "interfaces": [
      {
        "name": "port1",
        "ip": "192.168.100.1/24",
        "status": "up"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Practical Examples

### Check Pizza Menu (Get Device Info)

```bash
# Pizza version
curl -X GET "https://tonys-pizza.com/api/v1/menu" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer loyalty-card-123"

# Network version  
curl -X GET "https://fortimanager.company.com/api/v2/devices/fw-01" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key"
```

### Order a Pizza (Create Firewall Policy)

```bash
# Pizza version
curl -X POST "https://tonys-pizza.com/api/v1/orders" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer loyalty-card-123" \
     -d '{
       "size": "large",
       "toppings": ["pepperoni"],
       "delivery": true
     }'

# Network version
curl -X POST "https://fortigate.company.com/api/v2/policies" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
     -d '{
       "name": "Block-Social-Media",
       "action": "deny",
       "source": "LAN-Users",
       "service": "Facebook"
     }'
```

### Change Your Order (Update Interface)

```bash
# Pizza version
curl -X PUT "https://tonys-pizza.com/api/v1/orders/12345" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "special_instructions": "Extra cheese please!",
       "delivery_time": "ASAP"
     }'

# Network version
curl -X PUT "https://switch.company.com/api/v1/interfaces/GigE0/1" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "description": "Server Farm Connection",
       "vlan": 100
     }'
```

## Error Handling

**Pizza Error Response:**

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 400,
    "message": "Sorry, we're out of pineapple",
    "suggestion": "Try pepperoni instead?"
  }
}
```

**Network Error Response:**

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 400,
    "message": "Invalid VLAN ID",
    "details": "VLAN ID must be between 1-4094"
  }
}
```

**The Big Picture:** If you can understand ordering pizza through an app, you can understand network automation through APIs. The concepts are identical - you're just ordering firewall policies instead of pepperoni!
