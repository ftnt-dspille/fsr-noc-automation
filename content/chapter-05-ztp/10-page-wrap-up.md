In this chapter, we learned about Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) in FortiSOAR. We installed the ZTP Framework, created a ZTP Profile, and ZTP'd a FortiGate. We also installed and used the ZTP Examples Solution Pack.

### Takeaways

This framework is a powerful tool for automating the deployment and configuration of FortiGate firewalls. It can save time and effort on setup and maintenance, and be sold as a solution to customers. 



It's important to remember that this solution pack was fully created by CSE's, without the need for any product backend changes or NFR's. This is a great example of how FortiSOAR can be used to create **completely custom solutions** because of its flexible nature. These solutions are easily shareable and can be installed by anyone with access to the Content Hub.
